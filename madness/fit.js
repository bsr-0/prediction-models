/* Live spread regression over historical tournament games.
 *
 * The user enables variables; this fits the coefficients. That is the whole
 * point of the design: nobody has to assert whether more freshman minutes helps,
 * because the data answers it and the answer is shown.
 *
 * MODEL
 *   predicted margin = B . (z1 - z2)          [points]
 *   P(team1 wins)    = Phi(predicted margin / sigma)
 *
 * z is standardised within its own season, so a coefficient reads directly as
 * "points of margin per standard deviation of edge in this variable" -- a unit
 * anyone can check against intuition. sigma is the residual spread of the fit,
 * which is what turns a predicted margin into a probability.
 *
 * WHY MARGIN AND NOT WIN/LOSS. A 1-point escape and a 30-point demolition are
 * the same event to a classifier and very different evidence about the teams.
 * Fitting margin uses that, and RMSE/MAE/R2 become available as evaluation
 * metrics. The bracket still needs a winner, and gets one for free: predicted
 * margin > 0 is the same statement as predicted win, so accuracy is still
 * reported and is still what the board is graded on.
 *
 * NO INTERCEPT, deliberately. The rows are differentials, so the model must be
 * antisymmetric: swapping the two teams has to flip the predicted margin
 * exactly. A free constant would let it learn "the team written first tends to
 * win", which is an artefact of row order rather than basketball. Fixing the
 * intercept at 0 is what makes margin(A,B) = -margin(B,A) hold by construction.
 *
 * Mirroring every row to (-x, -m) would enforce the same thing, and it is what
 * the payload's fitting contract describes. It is skipped here because for a
 * zero-intercept fit the mirrored rows contribute an identical normal equation
 * -- they exactly double both X'X and X'y -- so they change nothing but cost.
 *
 * RIDGE, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT FIX. Several variables are near-collinear:
 * overall rating and national rank are near-substitutes, and both are largely
 * functions of offense and defense. The L2 penalty here is deliberately light,
 * because tightening it costs real accuracy -- measured on the full 26-variable
 * set, walk-forward:
 *
 *     ridge per 1k rows     accuracy   max |coefficient|   sign-flipping vars
 *     1  (shipped)            78.2%          40.7               14 of 26
 *     20                      73.7%          15.3                9
 *     400                     73.9%           3.0                4
 *
 * So the shipped model predicts best and reads worst. With all 26 enabled it
 * will print something like "-39 x rating + 36 x national rank": two
 * near-identical variables handed enormous offsetting coefficients. The SUM is
 * stable and predicts well; the individual numbers are not, and more than half
 * of them change sign between folds.
 *
 * This is not hidden. `stability()` measures it per coefficient and the
 * equation marks the unstable ones, because a displayed weight that cannot be
 * interpreted should say so rather than look authoritative. Enabling fewer,
 * less redundant variables gives coefficients that mean what they appear to
 * mean, at a small cost in accuracy.

/* ---------------------------------------------------------------- calibration
 *
 * THE LINK IS PART OF THE MODEL, NOT A FORMALITY. The regression predicts a
 * margin; something has to carry that margin to P(win). Two separate defects
 * lived in that step, and they need two separate fixes -- rescaling cannot fix
 * saturation and a fatter tail cannot fix scale.
 *
 * 1. SCALE. sigma was the IN-SAMPLE RMS residual, which understates
 *    out-of-sample error, and ridge shrinks predicted margins toward zero on
 *    top of that. Measured walk-forward over 756 held-out games, the model was
 *    systematically UNDER-confident through the 0.6-0.9 band:
 *
 *        bin        n   predicted   actual    gap    gap/SE
 *        0.6-0.7  117       64.9%    73.5%   +8.6      1.94
 *        0.7-0.8  124       75.0%    81.5%   +6.5      1.66
 *        0.8-0.9  122       84.8%    91.8%   +7.0      2.15
 *
 *    READ THAT TABLE CORRECTLY. No single bin clears two sigma by much; the
 *    evidence is that three ADJACENT bins all miss in the same direction, not
 *    any one of them. And the 0.5-0.6 bin's -6.3 point gap is NOT a finding --
 *    at n=84 and p~0.5 its standard error is 5.4 points, so it sits 1.16 SE
 *    from zero and points the opposite way from its neighbours, which is what
 *    noise looks like. It is recorded here so nobody later cites it as an
 *    S-curve.
 *
 *    That warning earned itself immediately. After calibration the same bin
 *    reads -15.1 points, -2.40 SE, which looks alarming until the bin edge is
 *    moved: [0.50,0.60) gives -2.40 SE, [0.52,0.62) gives -1.56, [0.54,0.64)
 *    gives -1.06. A real miscalibration does not care where the boundary falls;
 *    this one does, because a handful of coin-flip games crossing an arbitrary
 *    line is the whole effect. Judged on windows that do not depend on that
 *    choice: the wide [0.45,0.65) block is -0.72 SE over 117 games, and across
 *    all 756 held-out games the model expects 536.7 wins and observes 541,
 *    +0.40 SE. DO NOT tune against this bin.
 *
 *    Fix: one free parameter `a` in link(a * margin / sigma), fitted by
 *    minimising LOG LOSS. Log loss, not margin MSE, because probability is what
 *    the bracket is scored on -- the regression already optimised MSE and that
 *    is a different objective.
 *
 * 2. SATURATION, which is a LINK problem and survives any rescaling. The normal
 *    CDF has very thin tails: Phi(4) ~ 0.99997, Phi(6) ~ 1 - 1e-9. The shipped
 *    model already put 10 of 756 held-out predictions past 1e-4 of 0 or 1, the
 *    most extreme at p = 0.9999999977. None of them happened to lose, which is
 *    luck rather than safety: a 1-seed over a 16-seed is roughly a 1.3% upset
 *    historically (2 in ~156), so certainty at that level is wrong on the
 *    merits, and under log loss one miss at a pinned probability is unbounded.
 *
 *    Fix: Student-t link with the degrees of freedom fitted alongside `a`. It
 *    keeps every property that made margin regression the right choice -- still
 *    a margin, still antisymmetric, still monotone -- and fattens the tail by
 *    exactly as much as the held-out games support, rather than by assertion.
 *    nu = Infinity recovers the normal exactly, so the old behaviour remains
 *    reachable and is chosen only if the data prefers it.
 *
 * PROB_CLIP is a backstop under both, not a substitute for either. It exists so
 * that a pathological fit cannot produce a literal 0 or 1 and an infinite
 * score.
 *
 * IT DOES BIND, contrary to what this comment claimed until 2026-08-26. Whether
 * it binds depends entirely on nu. Measured per year on the walk-forward
 * calibration: with nu = 2-3 the closest any prediction comes to the bound is
 * 4.9e-3 to 2.9e-2, comfortably clear. With nu = Infinity (2014, the cold-start
 * fallback) it is 1.3e-4, past the clip, and with nu = 12 (2015) it is 9.5e-4,
 * also past. Thin tails saturate; fat tails do not. That is the Student-t doing
 * the job it was added for, and it is visible in the saturation behaviour even
 * though the mean-log-loss difference against the normal is not statistically
 * distinguishable (paired bootstrap 95% CI [-0.0032, +0.0159] on 630 games).
 *
 * HONEST ACCOUNTING, AND THE FIX. `calibrate()` here fits `a` and `nu` on
 * whatever rows it is handed, so calling it on the pooled walk-forward
 * residuals makes the resulting log loss mildly optimistic -- two parameters
 * informed by the same held-out games they are then scored on. Measured at
 * 0.00181 log loss on the 630 warm-year predictions.
 *
 * This comment used to say the alternative "costs more folds than 16 seasons
 * can spare". That was wrong: scripts/model_baseline.js now refits the
 * calibration per year on strictly earlier residuals only, shrunk toward a = 1
 * with weight n/(n + 63), which needs no extra folds at all -- the walk-forward
 * predictions already form a time-ordered sequence to calibrate along. The
 * frozen baseline reports that as the headline. This function is unchanged and
 * still fits on what it is given; the discipline lives in the caller.

 * This is the one check the accuracy figure cannot stand in for. Accuracy
 * grades the PICK (was the favourite right); it is unchanged by any monotone
 * reparameterisation of the link, so a model whose 70%s come true 90% of the
 * time and one whose 70%s come true 55% of the time can have identical
 * accuracy. The board prints the percentage, so the percentage is a separate
 * claim and needs its own evidence -- until now the page asserted "when it
 * says 70% it is right about 70%" with nothing behind it (2026-09 review).
 *
 * ORIENTED TO THE FAVOURITE. Every game is a pair (p, 1-p); binning the raw
 * team-A probability would put the same game in two bins depending on which
 * team the row happened to list first. Flipping to p >= 0.5 makes each game
 * count once, in the band the model's confidence actually sits in.
 *
 * `se` is the binomial standard error UNDER THE MODEL'S OWN CLAIM -- sqrt(p(1-p)/n)
 * at the bin's mean predicted p, not at the observed rate. That is the right
 * null: "if these percentages were honest, the observed rate would land
 * within about this much of them". At the observed rate a bin that went
 * 30-for-30 would report zero uncertainty, which is not what 30 games tells
 * you.
 *
 * READ THE BIN EDGES WITH THE WARNING IN calibrate()'s comment above: the
 * 0.5-0.6 bin is sensitive to where its lower edge falls, because a handful
 * of coin-flip games crossing an arbitrary line is a large fraction of a
 * small bin. The table is evidence about the band as a whole, not a verdict

 * board depends on: nothing forces the neighbours of x to be the mirrors of
 * the neighbours of -x when only one orientation is stored.
 *
 * SIGMA IS LOCAL. The spread of the neighbours' margins is a better
 * uncertainty estimate here than a global residual would be -- a query sitting
 * among tightly-agreeing games genuinely is more certain than one among
 * scattered ones. Floored so an unlucky set of identical neighbours cannot
 * produce infinite confidence.

 * r-1) * sum over every possible round-r opponent o of P(o survives to meet
 * t) * P(t beats o). Skipping the opponent's own survival term and just
 * multiplying win probabilities down one column would silently assume every
 * possible opponent is equally certain to arrive, which overstates the
 * favourite's odds in every later round.
 *
 * THE MERGE IS BOTTOM-UP OVER THE REAL TREE, not a seed-based table. Two
 * sibling subtrees of size 2^r each already carry a full round-by-round

 * needs only those distributions and the pairwise win function, so the exact
