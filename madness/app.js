/* Bracket Lab — one page, one question: what are you optimising for.
 *
 *   Maximise chance of winning   a FIXED RULE, not a search: region-by-region
 *                                construction over a seed/no-seed probability
 *                                blend at a constant contrarian risk of 0.35.
 *                                Backtested at pool 30 across 2011-2026.
 *
 *   Maximise expected points     the exact expected-points maximum, solved by
 *                                dynamic programming on the bracket. Equivalent
 *                                to sending whichever team is likelier to win
 *                                the tournament through every game.
 *
 *   Fitted model                 a ridge SPREAD regression fitted live on
 *                                tournament games. Predicts scoring MARGIN in
 *                                points, with P(win) following as
 *                                Phi(margin / sigma); see fit.js. It is not a
 *                                classifier and a coefficient is not a log-odds.
 *
 * THE FIRST TWO ARE NOT THE SAME BRACKET AND THE DIFFERENCE IS THE POINT.
 * On the current 2026 artifact both name Michigan, but the win-maximiser
 * gives up about 40 expected points (902 against 943) to nearly double its
 * chance of finishing first (7% against 4%) by taking upsets the field will
 * not. (This comment used to cite 872/941 and 9.9%/3.9% with different
 * champions -- figures from an earlier artifact; the numbers on the page come
 * from the payload, never from here.) In a winner-take-all pool the points
 * number is worth nothing and the trade is free; in a pool paying second and
 * third it is a real decision. Both scores are shown for whichever strategy is
 * selected, so the cost is visible rather than implied.
 *
 * WHY THE FIRST IS A FIXED RULE. It used to be the best of ~3,000 candidates
 * scored by a P(1st) referee. That route had never been backtested, and its
 * headline number was the maximum of a noisy estimate and so biased upward. The
 * fixed rule is the one with out-of-sample evidence: at pool 30 it reaches
 * P(1st) ~0.10-0.11 at any risk in 0.2-0.5, against 0.064 for the same
 * construction on Torvik ratings and 0.040 for a seed bracket. Choosing the risk
 * level per season measured WORSE than fixing it, so 0.35 is the middle of a
 * plateau rather than an optimum.
 *
 * WHAT USED TO BE HERE, AND WHY IT IS NOT. The page let the user pick the
 * variables, then the model family, then the training matrix. All three are gone
 * and all three went for the same reason: measurement said the choosing bought
 * nothing, or bought something worse.
 *
 *   variables      per-fold selection scored 0.46651 against 0.45698 for the
 *                  fixed canonical set, inside the bootstrap's noise
 *   model family   ridge beat kNN k=25 (CI [-0.040, -0.011]), LightGBM
 *                  (CI [-0.018, -0.001]) and local linear outright; kNN at
 *                  k=100 and k=500 could not be separated from it. Nothing beat
 *                  ridge, so the control could only select something worse
 *   training set   pooling 41,321 regular-season rows measured null against the
 *                  1,008 tournament rows on the same walk-forward split
 *   history prior  blending toward the seed-matchup base rate was MONOTONICALLY
 *                  worse: 0.45454 at weight 0, 0.45566 at 0.1, 0.48189 at 0.5,
 *                  0.56138 at 1.0. No round benefited -- the two that looked
 *                  like they did, R32 (+0.0032) and E8 (+0.0055), were the best
 *                  of 21 weights on 189 and 41 games and neither survived a
 *                  bootstrap
 *
 * The prior was not noise: alone it scores 0.561 against a coin flip's 0.693.
 * It is simply a cruder measurement of what barthag and t_rank already carry,
 * so blending it in diluted rather than complemented. Worth remembering before
 * anyone adds a second source of seed information.
 *
 * Choosing an OBJECTIVE is a decision the data cannot make for you, and those
 * controls stayed. Choosing an ESTIMATOR is a decision it can, and those went.
 *
 * The fit excludes the displayed season and every later one (walk-forward,
 * not leave-one-year-out -- see fitLinear()'s docstring in fit.js), so the
 * coefficients were never derived from the games being predicted, or from
 * tournaments that had not been played yet.

/* ---------- rule search (experimental strategy) ----------
 *
 * WHAT IT IS. One criterion per round; every game in that round goes to the
 * team better on that one variable. Two modes:
 *
 *   search  The user says which checkpoints a rule must reproduce (Elite
 *           Eight, Final Four, finalists, champion), over which range of
 *           prior played seasons, from which eligible criteria; fit.js
 *           ruleSearch() returns every rule that does, simplest first. The
 *           first `n` distinct brackets they give the displayed season are
 *           offered, ranked either simplest first or by how many played
 *           seasons OUTSIDE the fit range the rule also reproduces.
 *   hand    The user composes one criterion per round; the page applies it
 *           and reports which played seasons before this one it reproduces
 *           the checkpoints in. No search, so nothing is selected on.
 *
 * At least one of Elite Eight / Final Four must be a checkpoint: without an
 * early one the search cannot prune before the last constrained round and
 * would have to enumerate keys^rounds sequences per season.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT. Not a model, not validated, not scored: no P(1st), no EV,
 * no track record, never fed to anything. A rule that reproduces the last
 * two seasons is a description of those seasons found after the fact;
 * measured on the shipped data one season needs 2 criteria, two need 3, and
 * three (2024-2026) have none. The page shows that regress rather than
 * hiding it, and shows each searched rule's hit rate on the played seasons
 * outside its fit range -- the one number about it the user cannot tune.
 *
 * WALK-FORWARD, LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE HERE. Fit seasons and hand-mode checks
 * are played seasons strictly before the displayed one; ruleRange() clamps
 * the pickers to that. A 2026 bracket from a rule fit on 2024-2026 would be
 * a bracket fit on its own result.

 * body describe the same round and gives every line something to match
 * against the entry form. Grouping by region for the four rounds where that
